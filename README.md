# grf-policy-evaluation

Analysis of the effectiveness of protection policy efforts using heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) modeling. The motivation for building such models is to be able to design and target an intervention to maximize outcome. The generalized random forest (GRF) method by Wager and Athey (2019) is applied to evaluate the effect of protection policies on deforestation rate among the protected units.
